Cross thread/process observable changes to lists/sets/maps

single storage of data, notifications no matter where
    * in order to go cross process, intents are required
        * how to design intents to work - package localized?
    * cross threads should have a kind of synchronization?
        * synchronize or other concurrency? or irrelevant?
        * only safe way is either post or intent
    * otherwise communication can be event based. How to handle events?
        * events controlled by source
        * events controlled by master
        * other ?


decisions:
    * master should handle events
        * consequences:
            * need to have an external way to get information since information could be stored in anything
            *
